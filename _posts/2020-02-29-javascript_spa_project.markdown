At this point in my coding journey, I think my relationship with Javascript is best-described as "love/hate." Working with it feels like being on a ship in a stormâ€”every time I think I've gotten my footing, a wave or a strong wind knocks me off-balance again. Building out my project brought me through some especially turbulent waters.

When I first began this project, I tried going back to the books idea I was going to use for my Rails project. A user has a bookshelf, and each book can have notes. Before I got very far, though, I decided I didn't like the idea, after all. Instead, I turned my attention to another interest: role-playing games! Why not let a user build their ideal RPG party, each with its own members?

I started with my backend files, since that was most familiar to me. The project instructions warned against building horizontally, AKA building out all the models, then all the controllers, etc., so I did my best to focus on one element at a time. Parties came first, and then I began to implement individual members.

The real challenge began when I moved onto the frontend Javascript portion of the project. Some parts, like creating the forms for a party and a member, were fairly straightforward. Getting all my fetches and renders to work properly...less so. It can get a bit frustrating to troubleshoot when so many functions rely on and call each other.

After finally getting everything to work and display correctly, styling my page with CSS was actually kind of a nice reprieve. It still doesn't look exactly the way I'd like, but I enjoyed playing with different colors, fonts, and spacings.

I understand the benefits of Javascript; just doing one project has shown me that it can be an incredibly useful tool. In time, I may even come to like it. While I still would like to add tweaks to my project (implementing a delete function, for instance), I can say I'm happy with what I've created.
