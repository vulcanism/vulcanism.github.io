When I chose to major in creative writing in college, I knew that my chances of getting a decent job after graduation were slim to nil. Even with a minor in business administration, once I got my degree, it quickly became apparent that even the lowest-paying positions in my field were hard to come by.

But that was all fineâ€”the original plan had always been to learn a new, more useful skill after I'd finished college. That way, I could earn money and work on my passion projects in my spare time. The only problem was trying to figure out what, exactly, I should go about learning.

From the beginning, I knew that I'd want to get involved in the technology field, somehow. I couldn't call it my passion, but I'd dabbled in HTML and CSS multiple times over the years, and each time it'd been a good experience. I caught onto how the code worked quickly, and didn't mind tweaking it for hours until it looked just the way I wanted.

That said, I knew I'd need more than a rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS to get anywhere in the real world. So, I ended up sampling multiple different programs and specializations. None seemed to fit well; UX design was too people-focused, and database management gave me a headache. Some programs, too, seemed more concerned with pushing people through the course without making sure they actually understood the material.

So, I ended up researching software engineering. From what I could gather, it seemed like a broad enough category to be worth investing in, as well as something I could be capable of doing. Thus far, I've liked it more than any other technology-related field I've tried studying. I can only hope that feeling persists throughout the rest of the course!
