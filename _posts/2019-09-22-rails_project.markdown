Back towards the beginning of my time with Flatiron, I remember finishing my first project and thinking, "At least I'll never struggle this much again." Well, Rails was here to prove me wrong.

For my project, I first thought I'd try expanding on my Sinatra project, which allowed users to track their book collection and view the bookshelves of other users. However, I ended up disliking the idea halfway through, and even with the addition of a comments model, it didn't quite meet the requirements.

Scrapping that, then, I turned to another interest of mine: cryptids. Why not an app that lets users add to a database of known cryptids, as well as record their personal sightings? I knew I wasn't going to make the deadline thanks to overhauling my first idea, so rather than panic and rush things, I tried my best to accept the circumstances and work at a steady pace. With this in mind, I set about creating my models and associations.

The first step was creating my user model, as well as building out sign up, log in, and log out functionalities. From there, I created a model for cryptids, as well as observations (which I later realized would've sounded cooler if I'd called it "sightings," but oh well). While the associations weren't too difficult, it took a lot of trial and error to get my routes working how I liked. I spent days nesting and un-nested, adding and removing exceptions, and all other sorts of things.

Tragically, at this point, my project is still very uglyâ€”all black text on a white background, aligned left. When you're already behind schedule, aesthetics take a back seat. I'm hoping I find the time to beautify it a bit once I've caught up!

As always with these projects, I feel like I've learned a lot during the process of putting everything together. That said, I think I'm always going to have a love/hate relationship with Rails. All the associations between pages and routes make things work well, but it can be tricky to go in and test things when something breaks. Maybe moving forward I'll learn to love it more.
