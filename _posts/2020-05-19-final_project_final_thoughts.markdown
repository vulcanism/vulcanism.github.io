It's certainly been a long journey to get to this point. Looking back on the months and months of lessons I've gone through, there have been a lot of struggles, but a lot of breakthroughs, too. Admittedly, I was anxious about starting this projectâ€”despite all I'd learned, I still felt like I knew next to nothing. But deadlines must be heeded.

I started off by watching through the Expense Tracker demo videos, which helped in getting a general structure down for my project. For the subject of my application, I decided to reuse the idea from my old JS project: tracking cryptid sightings. The videos helped with setting up the various actions I would need, as well as a couple of containers.

From there, I had to expand and refactor my code to get it looking and functioning the way I wanted. I created a new container, `Main.js`, to render in my `App.js`, which immediately helped with organization. Figuring out routes took a bit of effort, especially when it came to viewing an individual cryptid. Funny how some of the simplest things end up taking the most time.

My final hurdle was getting my app to redirect after submitting a form. Research told me I had to use the `history` prop that's included as part of `BrowserRouter`. Of course, research also told me about a hundred and one ways to do that. In the end, it ended up being simpler than most solutions I found suggested.

Out of all the modules I've done at Flatiron, I feel like React/Redux is one that I actually find myself liking somewhat. Components can get a little confusing when you have a lot of them, but I appreciate the logic of passing down props and initializing with a state.

So, what now? I thought by the end of this program I'd have a clear idea of what I want to do career-wise, but I still feel uncertain. At the very least, though, I can breathe easier with this project completed. The only direction now is forward.
